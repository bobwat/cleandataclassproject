The purpose of the script attached, run_analysis.R, is to download accelerometer data for a training set and a test set.

The data are combined into one data set and the individual measurements from replicate measurements are excluded leaving a single data set containing the averages and standard deviations of replicate measurements of multiple body movements measured by mobile phone accelerometers.

The average of the means (means of the means of all measurements) and the averages of the standard deviations are calculate for each subject in the study.

The averages of the means (means of the means of all measurements) and averages of the standard deviations are calculate for each of the activities measured in the study.

A tidy data set containing the results for each measurement, mean and std, (the 86 right most columns) and a column "Activity.or.Subject" (left most) that indicates whether it is a measurement of an individual subject or of an activity.

The data set generated by the script will be stored in the "data" folder found in the working directory and can be opened into R by the command: read.table("tidy.dataset.txt",header=TRUE)
