The study involved a total of 30 subjects (listed 1 through 30) performing 6 activities: laying, sitting, standing, walking,
walking downstairs, and walking upstairs.  This information is contained in the first column, Activity.or.Subject, of the generated
dataset. Accelerometers (Acc) and Gyroscopes (Gyro) were used to make replicate measurements of various body motions in three
direction(X,Y and Z). Some of he motions were transform to the frequency domain via a Fourier transform (Freq). The means listed in 
the dataset are result of averaging the means of each replicate measurement for each subject and activity and the means of the 
standard deviations(std) for each set of replicates. The accelerometer data was recording in standard gravity units, and the
gyroscope data were measured in radians per second.  The data were then normalized and bounded with in -1 to 1. Each individual
measurement is a mean and has its own column variable with the descriptions given below:
"tBodyAcc.mean...X"
